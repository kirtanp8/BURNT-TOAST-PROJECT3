# BURNT-TOAST--Movie-Review-Site

# Overview 

The Brief for this project was to build a MERN stack application utilising:

* **M**ongoDB - document database
* **E**xpress(.js) - Node.js web framework
* **R**eact(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework
* Node(.js) - the premier JavaSCript web server

Working in a group of 3, it was decided that we create a website similar to Rotten Tomatoes with the sole focus allowing a user to discuss movies, comment on them, add movies to a Database and delete and edit what they have added. 

# Languages/Technologies Used

* HTML5, CSS3
* SASS, Bootstrap
* JavaScript ES6+
* React
* Node.js, Express.js
* MongoDB
* Axios
* Yarn, NPM
* Git, GitHub
* Font Awesome

# Approach / Planning

We thought it would be a good idea to start off by using a wire frame to picture something to aim for and used trello to plan what needed to be done in order to reach a the MVP.

# Home Page 

Below is a picture of our home page, where users can immediately see films being displayed with an automatic Carousel right in the middle of their screen + they can see its possible to search for a film through a search bar, however, it would have been impossible to add every single film to the database so we just added our favourites.

# Secure Routes 

In order to use all of Burnt Toast's features, the user must be logged in with an existing account which they can obtain from using the sign up form the website provides.

# Comments

One of the most interesting features of our website is being able to like comments + being able to comment and rate a move with the use of a form. I think here we could have made it so that the user can make the comment on the same page instead of being taken to a different page where they have to fill out a form.

# Search Bar

The implementation of a search bar is another cool feature to include and one that I'm very proud of, it's definitley neccessary and is also a feature used in the Rotten Tomatoes website. 

I also think the use of a dropdown menu is required here because we don't have every single film in our database, although this wouldn't be seen on most mainstream websites.

# Further Pages

Some further pages, include a user Profile page, an Edit form a Delete Button where users can delete and edit the movies they have added to the database.
