# BURNT-TOAST--Movie-Review-Site

# Overview 

The Brief for this project was to build a MERN stack application utilising:

* **M**ongoDB - document database
* **E**xpress(.js) - Node.js web framework
* **R**eact(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework
* Node(.js) - the premier JavaSCript web server

Working in a group of 3, it was decided that we create a website similar to Rotten Tomatoes with the sole focus allowing a user to discuss movies, comment on them, add movies to a Database and delete and edit what they have added. 

# Languages/Technologies Used

* HTML5, CSS3
* SASS, Bootstrap
* JavaScript ES6+
* React
* Node.js, Express.js
* MongoDB
* Axios
* Yarn, NPM
* Git, GitHub
* Font Awesome

# Approach / Planning

We thought it would be a good idea to start off by using a wire frame to picture something to aim for and used trello to plan what needed to be done in order to reach a the MVP.

# Teamwork

Working with Shahrukh and Arthur was a really fun experience, I would definitley enjoy working with them again too as we all worked really hard and had a lot of fun doing so, some days we worked 9.00am - 1.00am with a few breaks in between, but I personally never felt burnt out doing so, as I was doing what I loved and had company doing so. We used VSCode's LiveShare extension from my desktop most days and we would all work on seperate elements, when one of us got stuck, we would tackle the problems together.  

# Home Page 

Below is a picture of our home page, where users can immediately see films being displayed with an automatic Carousel right in the middle of their screen + they can see its possible to search for a film through a search bar, however, it would have been impossible to add every single film to the database so we just added our favourites.

# Secure Routes 

In order to use all of Burnt Toast's features, the user must be logged in with an existing account which they can obtain from using the sign up form the website provides.

# Comments

One of the most interesting features of our website is being able to like comments + being able to comment and rate a move with the use of a form. I think here we could have made it so that the user can make the comment on the same page instead of being taken to a different page where they have to fill out a form.

# Search Bar

The implementation of a search bar is another cool feature to include and one that I'm very proud of, it's definitley neccessary and is also a feature used in the Rotten Tomatoes website. 

I also think the use of a dropdown menu is required here because we don't have every single film in our database, although this wouldn't be seen on most mainstream websites.

# Further Pages

Some further pages, include a user Profile page, an Edit form a Delete Button where users can delete and edit the movies they have added to the database. 

# Challenges 

* Learning how to use 'bcrypt' for the first time to store and hash passwords was a very enjoyable challenge! 
* Getting used to working with the backend and seeing how both the front-end and back-end interact with one another. 
* Experiencing how to use Git development branches when working in a team, it was completelty new to me but honestly something I'm glad I have now got some experience with. 
* **React had an update** React Router 6 came in during the time we started our project and `Redirect` was replaced with `useNavigate`, so finding out the changes through documentation was probably a small glimpse of what industry practice could be like. 

# Wins 

* The design is really good, the colour schemes, the styling, the use of React Bootstrap, I can tell a lot of websites I use regularly most likely use it to. I wish I had found out about it when doing project two.  
* Working with Arthur and Shahrukh, I feel like I've made some good friends in those two. Time can go by very quickly when you have colleagues who are fun to work with. Not everything was pitch perfect of course, we had our disagreements but being able to compromise and respect one another's opinions/methods is what it means to be a team player.
* I had more chances to problem solve and debug errors.

# Future Enhancements

* Being able to edit the user profile would be a cool addition to have.
* Users being able to follow one another would be cool.
