# BURNT-TOAST--Movie-Review-Site

# Overview 

The Brief for this project was to build a MERN stack application utilising:

* **M**ongoDB - document database
* **E**xpress(.js) - Node.js web framework
* **R**eact(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework
* Node(.js) - the premier JavaSCript web server

Working in a group of 3, it was decided that we create a website similar to Rotten Tomatoes with the sole focus allowing a user to discuss movies, comment on them, add movies to a Database and delete and edit what they have added. 

# Languages/Technologies Used

* HTML5, CSS3
* SASS, Bootstrap
* JavaScript ES6+
* React
* Node.js, Express.js
* MongoDB
* Axios
* Yarn, NPM
* Git, GitHub
* Font Awesome

# Approach / Planning

We thought it would be a good idea to start off by using a wire frame to picture something to aim for and used trello to plan what needed to be done in order to reach a the MVP.

# Home Page 

Below is a picture of our home page, where users can immediately see films being displayed with an automatic Carousel right in the middle of their screen + they can see its possible to search for a film through a search bar, however, it would have been impossible to add every single film to the database so we just added our favourites.
